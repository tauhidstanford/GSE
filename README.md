# Geometry-and-statistics-preserving-manifold-embedding
Geometry and statistics-preserving manifold embedding for nonlinear dimensionality reduction

The implementation codes are for the manuscript to be appeared in Pattern Recognition Letters (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167865521002579?via%3Dihub). 

There are 3 demos. Please run them and see the difference in performance of GSE, IsoMap and LLE.
